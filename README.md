# Drone-Controller
A software in Unity that control a drone, through IP, using Socket communication. The code inside the drone uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 with a code uploaded by IDE Arduino

The code in unity requires an specific library using Web Socket.

To upload your code to ESP8266, you will need some libraries that will be available in the zip below. The ESP8266 can communicate using PPM with all kind of models of flight controllers. It has been tested with Betaflight (MatekSys F405 -AIO) and Cleanflight (SP racing F3) softwares. Please check the channel the code uses to arm the flight board.

All the libraries can be found in GitHub, consider download throught authors page to get always the best and most updated material.

Consider follow and give feedback or troubleshooting.

The folder contains the the code used and the source code of Unity plataform, that needs to be builded to generate the .exe.

The codes, Unity and IDE Arduino, were writed by Diego Caleg√°rio, to be used in academic purposes.

Sharing is caring.
